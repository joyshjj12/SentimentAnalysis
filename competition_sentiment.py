This CPU is a monster and runs very nicely and boosts to max clocks (6ghz on two cores and 5.7ghz on all cores) unlimited TDP settings but thermally limited at 90c with -60mV offset.  I have noticed that it runs a bit cooler than my previous 13900KF, especially when you consider the core to core deltas.  I use my PC mostly for gaming and encoding, so as long as you have a great case with plenty of air flow and a top notch cooler, you can easily run it air cooled without issues as it will just throttle itself when it hits whatever thermal maximum you set in the UEFI BIOS.In gaming workloads it never throttles though and stays at 5.7ghz all core boost the entire time with temps in CPU intensive games anywhere from the upper 50s to mid 60s and upper 40s to mid 50s in non CPU intensive games**Update**I have the CPU now at 5.8ghz with HT disabled and a -75mV offset and it's working like a charm and very stable in gaming workloads and encoding (it downclocks when it hits 90c for encoding workloads but for gaming it stays at 5.8ghz), which is amazing since it's on an air cooled setup, though the setup is as optimal as it gets for air cooling!  As for temps, they are a little lower than running it at 5.7ghz with HT enabled and a -50mV offset.  If I use a -75mV offset with 5.8ghz and HT enabled, my PC crashes.  So disabling HT definitely enables the CPU to use less power.If you're predominantly using your machine for gaming, then I definitely recommend turning HT off regardless as most games tend to run better with HT disabled.  But if you're using it for productivity or a blend of both productivity and gaming, then definitely turn HT on.The only mildly disappointing thing for me is that the memory controller isn't as good as I thought it would be.  Mine runs 48GB DDR5 7400 CL34 at 1.35V on the IMC, but to hit DDR5 7600 CL36 with stability I need to increase the IMC voltage to 1.41V which just isn't worth it if you ask me for such a minor bump in performance.

However, if you\'re a tinkerer at heart, eager to dive deeper than the surface-level information often presented in YouTube "videos" (or should we say, commercials), this is unquestionably for you. I\'ve acquired multiple units for various builds/configurations from a wide array of retailers—Best Buy, Newegg, and others included.For those considering making a purchase, I highly recommend using an Apex/Apex Encore MOBO or another reputable 2 DIMM board, particularly for AM5 or LGA1700, if overclocking is your goal. A high-quality cooler is crucial; for those opting for an AIO, ensure it includes at least an 8th gen Asetek pump and a 360 Thickboy copper radiator with performance fans—Avoid the aesthetically pleasing but functionally inferior Lian Li reversed SL Infinity Fans. Genuine static pressure fans, capable of efficiently doing the job, are what you need. Despite what your favorite YouTuber might suggest, you should prioritize efficiency over aesthetics.When selecting DDR5, opt for GOOD BINNED options. If a high-binned QVL compatible set isn\'t your choice, at a minimum, go for HYNIX A for single rank and HYNIX M for dual rank.The 14900K, when expertly tuned, becomes a gaming and multitasking powerhouse—achieving 43 to 44k in R23, with 6.2GHz boosting, 5.9GHz across its 8 physical cores and 8 threads, and 16 physical e-cores at 4.7GHz for a total of 32 threads, of which only 8 are virtual. With hyper-threading and e-cores enabled, it supports 8200 to 8400 MTS CL38 DDR5 RAM, boasts sub-55ns bus latency, and sub-9.3ns FWL. It\'s a marvel in Aida64 full, minus SSD, burn-in stress test stability. Adjusting all cores down to 5.8 and boosting to 6.0 can further reduce bus latency to easily below 50ns...Did I mention overall CPU temperatures typically remain between 35 to 40°C under heavy gaming loads, rarely exceeding 50°C? Despite the capability of 3 EATX connections to easily deliver over 400W of power, I\'d advise against exceeding 325W daily, as the performance gains beyond this point are minimal without extreme overclocking and cooling methods—increased voltage requirements could significantly shorten the lifespan of your CPU.

If the augmentation of the L3 cache wasn\'t primarily to address DDR5 issues stemming from the chiplet design, why not significantly enhance and accelerate the L1 cache? The design doesn\'t allow for it since it\'s not monolithic, which wouldn\'t be practical. Those well-versed in the subject matter understand this. While chiplets represent the future, we must acknowledge that this future hasn\'t fully materialized for every aspect of computing, allowing us to look beyond the "normie YouTuber AMD cults."Indeed, I own a 7800X3D build and absolutely adore it! It excels in gaming... primarily in GAMING! Thus, there\'s no cause for concern. Let\'s briefly touch on the "benefits" like reduced thermals and supposed platform longevity (as if motherboard chipset upgrades and advancements in power delivery methods don\'t occur... humor me, over the planned 6 years). I, too, long for Z390 features on my Z790 board (/end sarcasm), not to mention the potential for longer boot times when tinkering with DDR5 or PBO, or even under normal conditions, and texture stutter/tearing... oops, and all those other delightful topics Lisa tends to highlight without addressing the influence of influencers with communications degrees rather than computer science degrees.

They all had serious stability problems when in use.  After researching for weeks and reinstalling OS with no better result.  I finally disabled overclocking "AI overclocking", which was running as high as 1.6v.  I also found a BIOS setting after running some tools and set it INTEL FAIL SAFE.  this allowed me to run the AVX2 stress test successfully.  It basically throttles the chip.I can\'t tell you the frustration this caused figuring this out.  Everything from chrome browsers to Adobe CS would crash randomly for no apparent reason every few minutes while all "tests" showed it was fine.  I lowered my refresh rate to 60 from 120, killed AI overclocking and set the INTEL setting and now have a very stable system. It outperforms my 5950x when encoding, which is impressive.  It does run HOT even with water cooling.  IF I had it to do over again, I would avoid 13000 and 14000 chips as there is a OODLE issue as well when it comes to gaming with Unreal 5.  Basically an unfixable hardware flaw that affects some chips.Here\'s the thing, you will not notice a difference as nothing I use with the exception of HANDBRAKE, ever comes close to maxing out the chip when in use.  Adobe CS uses my 3080ti and the intel quicksync iGPU simultaneously which rarely went above 40%, and usually was around 15-20 when editing.  HW encodes for HD were at 350fps, software, 250, intel 300.  So a small advantage in Adobe CS is why I went with the 14900K vs KF.System was using "AI overclocking" pushing it to 6.2 roughly single core.  Disabled in BIOS now.Specs: Asus z290a Wifi II, Corsair 96GB DDR5 5600, Samsung 990 Pro, CPU Water cooled, 3080tiSo the "K" is basically useless for me at this point and don\'t see myself doing it manually as it\'s just not worth it to me.

I say who cares. If you have a 13900k, don't upgrade, but if you have an older PC or 12th Gen, this is a worthy upgrade. I absolutely love mine. It's a monster of a CPU.I honestly don't recommend air cooling it. It can get pretty hot and there are only a small handful of air coolers that can handle this 14900k without setting power limits (which most people don't know how to do, let alone even know what that means)If you're not doing a custom water loop to cool your 14900k, I recommend you do what I've done to cool mine, you dont neeeed to, but it helps. I have an AIO (All-In-One Cooler) and I setup a push-pull configuration on my radiator. That means I have 3 fans on the bottom blowing in through the radiator, and 3 more fans blowing up and out of the case. Both are blowing upward. It creates more airflow. One side is pushing the air, the other side is helping pull that air through. Then I got a thermalright contact frame. Any LGA 1700 contact frame should work but the thermalright version is cheap. It might say 12th/13th Gen but it will also work on 14th Gen. So get an AIO, setup a push-pull fan configuration and get a contact frame. It's helping my Temps significantly. I typically stay in the high 50's or low 60's during 4K gaming. This CPU draws a ton of power so you might see it bump up to 80⁰ occasionally, for a very brief moment.

The only water coolers that don\'t leak for me were the ones i built but water cooling is expensive and you have to inspect them at least every 3 months for debris in the tank or leaks. with air i only have to clean the pc 2x a year.yes you can control temps with an air cooler, and get the same temps as a 3 fan radiator water cooler. I\'ll post the results without adding a watt limit in the mobo post screen.here is the parts i bought to air cool running the new cinabench 2024 for 30 mins i can get max performance on a defualt non OC not hitting above 99C on the P cores1.

(note this is from CPU testing that punishes the CPU realistically i don\'t see this CPU going over 88c even on the most demanding game in 3 years.i personally do not recommend OC this CPU its already been pushed to its limits by INTEL at best for another 100 watts when all you\'re getting is 3-4 more FPS and that\'s not worth it. and all these people bragging a 6.2-6.5ghz OC, there just flexing for clout, then they take the CPU back to default. i already have my P cores spiking to 6.002 at 288-300 watts, and under 99c temps; adding 0.198mhz will meaning nothing for apps and gaming.personal note the MSI MEG Z790 ACE MAX Gaming Motherboard is absolutely amazing at squeezing out all the performance of the 14900k worth the $700 price never crashed during testing that 26 power phases is godly  compared to my last gen EVGA x299 dark had 12 phase...RIP EGA :(', 'rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'date': 'Reviewed in the United States on February 11, 2024'},

It is incredibly fast. I had a Davinci Resolve video project file that I rendered on my old setup, the i7-6850K and it took just over 22 minutes to complete the render. On the new i9, the exact same file was re exported, took just over 8 minutes..! almost a 3x speed increase.!Also, when you speed up footage in Resolve, the old cpu could not play it back smoothly, it would jump and chug like crazy, the new i9, it plays it back sped up 800% no problems and I can actually see how it looks without having to export the entire video clip to see it playback the retimed footage smoothly.Applications open u p much faster too, but that could be more due to the pcie4.0 nvme system drive that is much faster than the previous version nvme I had in the old build.The one thing I do not like about the new cpu, is the number of pci lanes. You only get 20, 16 are pcie5.0 and 4 are pcie4.0. This wont be an issue for most people, but my old cpu had 40 lanes, allowing me to run 3 GPU's at the same time, and YES, I needed them, I use GPU rendering software that can use up to 8 GPU's in one system on one license and every additional GPU speeds up your render times a lot when rendering out 3D sims.With this new cpu, I can only run 2 GPU's and they run at 8x, cause they share the 16x, and that does leave me 4 full pcie4.0 lanes for the system drive.It is not a deal breaker, and the increased speed overall is well worth it. One thing EVERYBODY should be aware of, is these new intel chips have P cores and E cores. Something my old cpu did NOT have. E-cores can severely impact certain software performance. When I booted up the new machine and tried my Ableton DAW  for the first time, I was expecting to be so happy with a performance boost, and the software was literally almost unusable.! The E-cores were slowing the software down so bad, I could barely change settings in the preferences.! It was that bad.

It heats very well, stock cooler not enough, my pc even shut downed 3 times when playing high end games used with stock cooler. A decent air cooler is enough to calm down this one, it is not unlocked in fact, so no explanation needed i guess. If u are gonna build a new pc build in 2024 or onwards , please consider 12th gen atleast because u can have great future upgradability chance. When said all these, i took this over 12400f because i felt this enough for my needs and it didn't disappointed me. When considering it is just an i5 i got flabbergasted by its performance fr. Many people say 11th gen is bad but i felt it as worthy for the money i spent and im not gonna do upgrades in future so... Yeah overall it is a good product and im happy with it👍. Once again, don't even consider any of 11th gen processors if u are gonna pc build in 2024 and future because 13th gen and 12 th gen is way more future proof that this 11th gen.

This processor at an affordable price more than doubled, maybe tripled my cpu performance while still accepting my older DDR4 3200 ram and m.2 storage.  Also allows me to update my machine to Windows 11 as a 13th gen cpu.  I considered running 8th gen chip in my older mother board by flashing the bios with a coffee lake chip support, but rather than deal with all the isolation on the cpu pins and bios frustration, i opted to spend 60 bucks for a new MATX board and this cpu.  The only complaint I have is the cpu box was clearly opened and I am left wondering if this was dropped into someone else's board at some point and returned.  I don't like that when the product is being advertised as new.  The seller was Amazon LLC too so I am not sure what is going on with that.  I have half a mind to return it for a replacement but alas it is installed and seems to be running fine so I really don't want to pack it up and ship it back.  My chip runs pretty cool with the stock fan, 3d mark cpu stress tests never took it above 71C but that fan sure kicked in when the cpu was running at 100%, utilization.  At idle on my computer the chip purrs along at 30-35C with the fan running somewhere around 40%.  All in all a good purchase to get my machine ready for Win 11.

Almost all deserve 5 stars (commented if one or more stars are taken off). Instead of reviewing item by item I decided to write one review for all products used for one specific PC build. The purpose of this PC build - fancy compact gaming system.Items used in this build:--Item 1) OCPC Mini ITX Case, Hydra Italy Mini ITX PC Case, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BK6D77DG/Very good case – compact, cool looking and efficient. The black color is the only variant I found on Amazon. With only cooling from top-down CPU cooler, the i7-13700K based system passed the stress test very well. Riser cable is not included – actually the riser cable for GPU orientation as shown on Amazon item photo does not exist. In order to build the system as shown, I bought a flexible riser cable (Item #2) and twisted it to 180°. Another simpler solution is to install GPU upside down as presented by other reviewers on Amazon.--Item 2) EZDIY-FAB PCIE 4.0 16x Extreme High Speed Flexible Riser Cable PCI Express Port GPU Extension Card-Dual Reverse Connector for ITX [21cm]. Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09S5DW3RX/-Does the job - exactly what I need for the project. Note: During system build I have to remove the bracket from the cable male connector and install it back after passing cable through the case hole. Power supply: Cooler Master V750 SFX Gold Full Modular, 750W, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08LP7B7FM/- Works as supposed to. PSU had a noticeable burning smell for about 5 days, considering this is normal for a new PSU. If you want to build more powerful gaming system, I recommend the PCIe 5.0 ready 850W SFX PSU, something like ARESGAME GL850 https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CHDS4J33/SFX-L PSU will work in Hydra Mini as well, but cable management will be tougher.--Item 4) CPU: Intel Core i7-13700K, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BCF57FL5/- Good CPU, working well in gaming.--Item 5) Motherboard: ASUS ROG Strix B760-I Gaming WiFi, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BR8TVLPL/- Working as described, nice looking MB. Thank you, ASUS - now ROG motherboards have the Memtest86+ built in BIOS. This very helpful feature allows PC builders to check memory before operating system installation and prevent blue screens and failures during OS install and system use in case of defective memory.In my case originally ordered CORSAIR DOMINATOR PLATINUM RGB DDR5 RAM 64GB (2x32GB) 6400MHz (Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0C1R95SPW/) was defective. Both memory modules came to life and showed ok in BIOS but Memtest86+ got errors. I did test modules one by one in the same memory slot and found out that one of the modules is the cause of the failures. Returned the defective memory and bought another from a different brand (Item #6). ASUS ROG Motherboard chosen for the look. In my opinion the best Intel (or may be overall) mini ITX MB on the market is MSI MPG Z790I Edge WiFi Gaming Motherboard (Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BHCJ6KQ2/ ) I own one and have a very best experience.--Item 6) Memory: TEAMGROUP T-Force Delta RGB DDR5 Ram 64GB (2x32GB) 6000MHz, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BNTV1945/-Very good product, works as described, nice looking, recognized by Aura Sync.--Item 7) Graphics Card: MSI Gaming GeForce RTX 4060 Ti 16GB, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CCFZMHSM/- Graphics card work as supposed to, have low power consumption. This GPU was chosen for the look only. Anyway, the presented system can play all modern games well at 1440p. But if you want the very good gaming experience, I will recommend at least RTX 4070 Ti like MSI Gaming GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Ventus 2X 12G OC. And the very best (talking about built on Hydra Italy Mini Case) will be the system with 850W PCIe 5.0 SFX PSU and:a) \xa0MSI MPG Z790I Edge WiFi Gaming Motherboard, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BHCJ6KQ2/b) Intel Core i9-13900KF, \xa0https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BCFM3CJ4/c) ASUS ProArt GeForce RTX™ 4080 16GB OC, ( Amazon https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C75J66C8/). This compact GPU has included Graphics Card Holder which will work with presented builtI own all of these (a,b,c) components packed in another fancy mini ITX case (Phanteks PH-ES217A_BK02 Evolv Shift 2 Air Mini-ITX case, Fabric Side Panels) and they performed superb in games.--Item 8) SSD Disks:8.1) Primary (system): WD_BLACK 2TB SN850X NVMe Gen4 PCIe M.2 2280 WDS200T2X0E, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0B7CMZ3QH/8.2) Secondary (backup and media data): Crucial P3 Plus 4TB PCIe Gen4 NVMe M.2 CT4000P3PSSD8, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0B25M8FXX/- Very good products, works as described, no problems.--Item 9) Antec Power Supply Sleeved Cable, PSU Cables, PSU Extension Cable Kit / 1x24pin ATX / 2x8pin (4+4) EPS / 3X (6+2) pin PCI-E, 30cm Length with Combs, Dual EPS Red Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BN3H2K17/- Perfect fit for this project, good cables, looks nice.--Item 10)CPU cooler: ID-COOLING IS-67-XT Black 67mm Height Low Profile CPU Cooler, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CFPY9CKZ/- Good design, keeps i7-13700K adequately cool in open Air PC Case. Mounting for regular size 120mm fan included. Easy installation - just install radiator 1st and mount fan after. ID-COOLING IS-67-XT chosen because of black color. In my opinion DeepCool AN600 Low Profile CPU Cooler (Amazon https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C4P8ZPWT/) has a little bit better cooling performance (I have one in a very compact Flex ATX build).--Item 11) EZDIY-FAB Moonlight 120mm RGB PWM Case Fan, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07X8T79QY/Good, quiet and nice-looking fan. Actually, it is a leftover piece from a 9 fans ATX tower system build. If you want to build a similar system with a similar look, I recommend Cooler Master MF120 Halo² Fan Duo-Ring ARGB (Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BWKZGYXJ/). This fan has a similar look but has better airflow / air pressure.---Item 12) 24 Pin RGB Cable Extension Kit (used ARGB strip only), Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07WN4G7KC/- The power cable connector to MB too tight - did not go all the way down, afraid to broke the MB if try to apply more force (the regular PSU cable fits perfect). Connector to PSU too tight as well, but was able to connect all the way down. Actually, in reality the system with this cable does not look good (too much RGB). Did use ARGB strip only for decoration purposes on the GPU side.--Item 13) Thermal Paste: ARCTIC MX-6. Optional - I have a very good experience using this thermal paste brand and always using it for the builds (so thermal paste provided by ID-COOLING was not used). Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09VDLH5M6/-----------Overall, I assume the goal is reached - the presented system can play recent games and look very cool (in my humble opinion).Read more', 'rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'date': 'Reviewed in the United States on January 8, 2024'},

According to HWMonitor, the CPU package hovers around 15W power consumption doing desktop tasks (web browsing / email / Office).Compared to my i7-6700K (video card and PSU unchanged; new motherboard, ram, and heatsink&fan):- System power consumption at idle and doing desktop tasks is about 5W higher than my 6700K in normal mode, or about 15W lower in “eco” mode in my motherboard’s settings- Synthetic benchmarks (3dmark CPU Profile) indicate 2x performance for single-core processing and 4x performance for maximum threads- Real-life video encoding is roughly 3x faster using PowerDirectorNote that this LGA1700 socket is known to allow some bending (this causes poorer contact with heatsink which may cause throttling). This can be remedied by installing a pressure plate (I bought a Thermalright LGA1700-BCF for around $12).If you don’t need a built-in GPU, consider the i7-13700KF; the built-in GPU is nice to have but not always worth the premium.

I’m a pretty hardcore gamer and this cpu is the most amazing thing I’ve ever had when it comes to a high end build. I paired it with a rtx 4080 and needless to say this cpu doesn’t disappoint. Now, this review isn’t about pricing because we all know this cpu is expensive and honestly if you’re only gaming then maybe a 13600k would suffice. However, if you are streaming, photo editing, video editing etc…. Then this is the right cpu for you. I’m able to snap together YouTube videos in seconds NOT minutes or anywhere near it. I’m able to stream and game at the same time with less than a 10 fps loss while gaming and streaming on the highest quality settings. My wife loves it for photo editing bc everything is just perfect. Only downside is that it does run hot but you can get a good 240-360mm aio that will tame this cpu with ease. All the issues I use to have on the 10th gen platform are completely irradiated now that I own this cpu. I did go with the ddr5 and honestly for me it runs better than ddr4. Tech reviewers say otherwise but from personal experience ddr5 is the future NOW. Performance issues I use to have with ddr4 and weaker cpus are just gone now. I can do so much and this cpu doesn’t break a sweat. For instance, ddr4 for whatever reason sometimes wouldn’t work with xmp although it was advertised. I like to tinker so it wasn’t an issue BUT sometimes it’s just nice to do a single click and let it dial itself in and that’s what ddr5 has done for me. I’ve used several different sticks with this cpu and from all of them I went with Corsair vengeance. Honestly, this is the most bada$$ cpu I’ve ever owned or seen in a personal system of mine. If you have the money I couldn’t recommend it enough. Everybody has different needs and in my case I needed this cpu. It hasn’t disappointed. As for amd, if you want the bugs and issues go ahead and grab one of those cpus and tell me how that goes. This cpu can do everything and more.

It works out at $30 per core, which is even less than a cost per core of previous generation Kaby Lake CPUs.The downsides are - the multiplier overclocking is disabled and the base clock is pretty low, the TDP is limited to 65W.In practice what this means is a lot of benchmarks that can take advantage of 6 cores will look better than a 4-core CPU, but in single threaded tasks or some games, faster clocked cores can still give better responsiveness.The i5 8400 offers more than good enough performance for most tasks and uses very little power in idle and is still limited to around 65Watts under load. In my view this makes it a very good CPU choice for a main productivity/gaming machine that is powered on 24/7 or most of the day.The 6 cores future-proof the computer in case one suddenly wants to try their talents and a video game streamer or something similar.Paired with 370 chipset it also opens up a possibility of an upgrade, if someone really finds this CPU to be too limiting.Overall, I find this particular CPU to be of very good value currently and also offering enough performance for the majority of computing tasks - hence 5 stars.Read more', 'rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'date': 'Reviewed in the United States on October 9, 2017'},

Ya que como mi anterior PC tenía Intel de 4ª generación, CPU de DDR3, y placa con socket de 1150. Para saltar a la nueva generación, tenía que cambiar la CPU, que además, había que cambiar la placa, y había que cambiar la RAM. Opté por el Intel Core i5 8400 de 2.8GHz, la RAM era Ballistix Sport LT de 16GB DDR4 de 2400MHz (8x2) y la placa era Gigabyte B360M-DS3H.Con todo esto, manteniendo la gráfica y la fuente de alimentación, obtuve unos mejores resultados tanto en embalaje de productos, como de calidad de estos mismos. Del i5 4440 al i5 8400 ha sido como un 30% o más de mejora, así como la mejora de la RAM al pasar de 1866MHz y DDR3 a los 2400MHz y DDR4.La CPU si bien a mí se me calentaba unas pocas veces debido a las múltiples tareas que hice los primeros días (instalar programas, juegos, etc), el rendimiento es indiscutible que es de calidad-precio. Por menos de 200 € tienes una buena CPU. Con respecto a los juegos, probando The Witcher III: Wild Hunt en Alto-Ultra mantuve alrededor de los 60 y los 75fps (activé la V-Sync porque el tearing del juego me molestaba, y mi monitor era de máximo 75Hz), y los resultados eran sobresalientes, sino que más destacables. Si queréis montaros un buen PC para jugar, el i5 8400 es una buena inversión para lo que vale, podéis jugar a prácticamente todo con este procesador. Se aprovechan muy bien los 6 núcleos y 6 hilos que tiene, con frecuencia de base de 2.8GHz y turbo de hasta 4.0GHz.Read more', 'rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'date': 'Reviewed in Spain on September 4, 2018'},

It arrived in great shape, no issues there.I was a little leery of it not working but I pulled out the old motherboard and processor but in the new ones and the computer started up and has been working great.The only problem that I've had, which is not the fault of this processor, is that putting in a new motherboard causes all of the authentication for Microsoft Office applications to fail.

Out the box it\'s running 4.9 for 1 core, 4.8 for 2-4 cores, and 4.7 for more than 4 cores.  Without tweaking any settings, voltages are in the mid 1.2\'s.  In general gaming use, temps run in the mid-50s with this rig, but the XTU benchmark can push them into the 60s.  A few half-hearted attempts at overclocking reveal that this chip, like many of its kind, isn\'t particularly happy with AVX over 4.7, and some of the cores seem more susceptible to this than others.  Still, I couldn\'t get it over 80 degrees C; platform instability happened first, at 5.1 with an AVX offset of -2.  (5.1 at -3 ran at 1.4 with not much other tweaking required).  Combined with a couple Samsung NVME drives (512G Evo and 1TB Pro) and some 3200 GHz LED RAM, boot times are superfast (with Fast Boot on) - blink and you miss it.I was able to push a 7680x1440 three-monitor rig to 60 fps minimum in GTA Online; average framerates were in the 90s, though nvidia Surround had me limited to 60 Hz.  The same 1080Ti could only do 23 fps minimum with my prior rig, which was Z77/3770K@4.4 GHz based.Nearly any other game I can push my ROG PG279Q to its full framerate of 165 Hz without difficulty.  I like to play Rocket League at 250 fps to minimize input lag and was pleasantly surprised to find that I could keep it over 200 and still get what that game calls "quality" graphics on both the single-monitor and triple-monitor setups.

H-K: Alyx is pretty cranked up as far as quality and it runs smoothly.  The 9400F was  noticeably maxing out in performance.  While  the 9700K is only around 12-14%, faster, it is enough headroom to smooth out performance in gaming.  Everything also felt snappier as far as desktop usage.  It should give me enough processing power until the next advances in transistor fabrication.This processor probably  doesn't overclock well with the performance hit it takes at higher temperatures.  Inadequately cooled, the CPU Benchmark was 89%.  Once I increased the airflow, it came in at 100%.  With my 9400F, the gaming PC score was around 90%.  With the 9700K, I’m at 108%.

Idle temps stay in the 30s. That's with the cpu wattage unlocked and raising the pl1 and pl2 settings a bit in the bios and a single intake and single exhaust fan in a mid size case. I learned a long time ago that ambient room temp and fan curves are very important. You want to exhaust as much hot air as you can out of the case as fast as possible. You can mount a skyscraper to your CPU and have 12 case fans, if your room temp is high and you don't set proper fan curves, you'll still run hot. I don't care about cinebench or other benchmarks, most games people play and apps people use on a daily basis will never stress the CPU anywhere near what a benchmark will. If you do a lot of heavy video editing and conversion work and raise your wattage limits way up then yes go for a higher end cooling solution .Edit: I've since installed an Intel RH1 cooler (the one that comes with the i9) on this chip and it dropped my temps by an average of about 8c.

This 10850k boosted just from the base BIOS on my mobo to 4.8Ghz on all 10 cores and things are buttery smooth. I play Control at 1440p with maxed settings and get a fairly consistent 90 FPS and my temps and component usage are all nice and ideal levels. I was able to play Half-Life Alyx, and stream it while capturing my webcam footage without any temp issues and honestly hitting my VRAM cap on the GPU before any actual performance issues from bottlenecking.Honestly, I can't be happier with this purchase. I hate reviews without negatives, it feels fake. And I wish I had some, but seriously it is playing games I enjoyed before with far better performance at higher settings. It is handling my crazed multitasking and occasional streaming without a sweat. Ryzen 5000 series may be able to squeeze some better gaming performance overall than this. But at the price I got it, and the issues with availability of a 5800x (which is more expensive too) I couldn't say I'd be happier with that. Especially when the AMD motherboards don't look quite as nice either. My friend has a 5800x, I've played on his machine and heard from him in his own use that its good, but nothing there seemed to blow this 10850k out of the water.Read more", 'rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'date': 'Reviewed in the United States on April 10, 2021'},

{'Product Name' : 'Intel Core i7-10700K Desktop Processor ', 'Price' : '243.58', 'Power Consumption' : '125', 'text': 'Don’t let the 125w TDP fool ya because this chip runs WAY cooler than previous gens. Tested temps using OCCT stress test for about 3 hours, alongside my Noctua NH-D15 cooler. The highest I’ve seen the temp spike up to was 71c. Note that OCCT is a heavy synthetic test that pushes the CPU to the limit. Regular gaming temps will never reach that high. I’ve had the chip for almost two months now and accumulated quite a bit of gaming hours during that time. The games I played included a mix of intensive AAA titles like CoD Warzone and AC: Odyssey to light eSport ones such as Rocket League and Rainbow Six Siege. Highest temps are always in the 50s to mid 60s range. That is a huge difference compared to my old i5 6600k that spiked to over 80c at times! My brother who bought a 9900k last year was also amazed by how much cooler 10th gen runs and even said that he wished he waited a bit longer before upgrading. Note that both the 9900k and 6600k have lower TDPs than the 10700k yet still run warmer. The reason as to why 10th gen runs cooler is because intel made modifications to the IHS of the cpu and upgraded their Thermal Interface Material. Other then the improvement in the temperature department, I’ve also noticed a big difference in gaming performance. Despite having a 2080 super, my PC used to struggle to reach and stay at a consistent 100+fps at 1080p. CPU intensive games like AC Odyssey often dropped to like 50fps. This is a clear indication that there was bottleneck on the CPU side. With this new 10700k, My PC now has no problems reaching and maintaining that sweet consistent 144+ FPS on light competitive eSport titles and 100+FPS on demanding CPU intensive AAA titles. Also, note that I am running the CPU at stock settings right out the box and have not messed with overclocking yet. Nonetheless, I am very satisfied with this CPU and I highly recommend it.Read more', 'rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'date': 'Reviewed in the United States on July 25, 2020'},

I missed you Intel.The PC world is weird. Always chasing $50 savings. Too many games have CPU bottlenecks. I debated hard between just buying a 3700x to replace my 2700x versus the hard MB/CPU upgrade to Intel. But AMD had left me frustrated. My 2700x was never maxed out and I couldn’t tell what was bottleknecking me. The 3700x didn’t promise much higher clock speeds so I wasn’t sure if an upgrade would help. I play Rust on 1440p and my GPU and CPU would sit at 60%, utilization or less with frames only around 70fps. First test with the 10700k stock and I’m at 135fps, max graphic settings. My GPU is now pumping out 99% utilization and the game feels amazing.This chip runs cool on stock. Idk where all the bad thermal predictions came from, but it didn’t happen. Haven’t even OC’d it yet and honestly I may not need to until I upgrade off of my 2080super. But that’s not happening any time soon. I’m hitting 144fps on 1440p max settings now in every FPS game and that was the goal.Thank you Intel, you nailed this one. The 9th gen had some cost/heat issues and that made me give AMD a try and I’m glad to be back!For anyone choosing a card. The 10700k is the sweet spot for gaming and streaming. If you only game, I think the 10600k is a cheaper but same performance.
